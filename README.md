# Hi there 👋, my name is Ashish Rai

I'm an AI researcher seeking to understand how deep learning models work better.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on understanding shortcut learning in small and large language models.
- 🔭 I’m also working on quantifying the performance of pure vision models to solve the [ARC-AGI challenge](https://arcprize.org/).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interpreting language models and how they perform arithmetic operations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mechanistic interpretability of language models.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with coming up and proving theories about large language models.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
